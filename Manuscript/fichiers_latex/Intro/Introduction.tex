	\blockquote[IPCC Special Report: Global Warming of 1.5~$^\circ$C {\citep{Rogelj2018}}]{\textit{"Under  emissions  in  line  with  current  pledges  under  the  Paris  Agreement  (known  as  Nationally  Determined  Contributions,  or  NDCs),  global  warming  is  expected  to  surpass  1.5~$^\circ$C  above  pre-industrial  levels,  even  if  these  pledges  are  supplemented  with  very  challenging  increases  in  the  scale  and  ambition  of  mitigation  after  2030.  This  increased  action  would  need  to  achieve  net  zero  CO$_2$  emissions  in  less  than  15  years.  Even if this is achieved, temperatures would only be expected to remain below the 1.5~$^\circ$C threshold if the actual geophysical response ends up being towards the low end of the currently estimated uncertainty range.\\Transition challenges as well as identified trade-offs can be reduced \textbf{if global emissions peak before 2030} and \textbf{marked emissions reductions} compared  to  today  \textbf{are  already  achieved  by  2030}."\\}}
